# Introduction
The purpose of the energy transfer experiment is to understand the power and energy transfer from an AC Generator and investigating the rotational kinetic energy from a flywheel. The energy transfer is used for demonstrating the energy conversion of stored gravitational potential energy into electrical energy. 

$P=\frac{V^2}{R}$

Where $P$ is the power from the energy transfer created by the AC Generator, $V$ is the voltage, and $R$ is the resistor of $100\Omega$. From the AC Generator there is a voltage output that must be created into power to determine how much power is created depending on the amount of weight, height difference there is.\
To determine the difference between the power of the energy transfer from the AC Generator and the rotational kinetic energy from the flywheel, then efficiency will determine what provides more power. 

$\text{efficiency}=\frac{\text{energy generated}}{mgh}\cdot 100$


$\text{efficiency}=\frac{KE_{rot}}{mgh}\cdot 100$

Where $mgh$ is the potential energy from the distance of the pulley and the ground $h$, and the mass $m$ is from the string and weight. $KE$ is the rotational kinetic energy is determined by the rotational inertia $I$ and angular velocity $\omega$:

$KE_{rot}=\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$

Moreover, the inertia is determined by the mass $m$ of the flywheel and the radius $R$ of the flywheel:

$I=\frac{1}{2}mR^2$
